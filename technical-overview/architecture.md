# Architecture

cQube is envisioned as a ready-to-use / pre-packaged, configurable, and extendable DPG solution to enable observability and action towards effective policy implementation in education and other sectors, involving various stakeholders across govt, society, and private sectors.

The architecture of cQube has been revised to enable flexibility in configuration:

* Spec-based architecture has been created for cQube Ed with API-first design
* There are 5 blocks: Installation > Ingestion > Processing > Visualisation > Actions
* All the blocks can be used individually and as an end-to-end solution by cQube adopters

The terminologies used in the architecture can be found [here](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CQUB/pages/3258024044/cQube+Design+Document+Nov+2022#1.-Terminologies).
