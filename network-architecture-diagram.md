# Network Architecture diagram

The following steps define how the cQube setup and workflow is completed in AWS. cQube mainly consists of the areas mentioned below:  


1. Private Subnet
2. Public Subnet
3. AWS Load Balancer
4. IAM user and Role creation for S3 connectivity.

The cQube network setup process is described in the block diagram below:

* The Yellow arrows in the network diagram indicate the file upload usersâ€™ connectivity through the load balancer.
* The Green arrow in the network diagram indicates the end user's connectivity through the load balancer.
* The purple color arrow in the network diagram indicates the developers connectivity through the VPN.

### **Private Subnet**

Private subnet is used to secure the cQube server from public access. The instance will not be having the public ip. An EC2 instance will be created in a private subnet and all cQube components will be installed in this.  
****

**Note:** For the concurrent users  between 100 to1000, The recommended Nginx machine type  would be 'm' or 'c' series 2 core machine to use. And need to increase the machine size according to the concurrent users traffic.  
****

The steps involved to create EC2 instance in private subnet

* Create a virtual private cloud\(VPC\) in AWS 
* Create a subnet in the created VPC with no Routing Table attached to Internet gateway
* Create an EC2 instance to install all the cQube software components.

**EC2**: cQube server

    - create an ec2 instance with below mentioned configuration

    - 8 core cpu, 32 gb ram and 1 tb storage

**security\_group:**

 ****     - port 4200, 3000, 8000 inbound from nginx 

      - port 4201, 3001, 9000, 8080, 8096, 22 inbound from openvpn server

**Load Balancer:**

    - create a load balancer 

    - configure it to connect to nginx on port 80, 443

**Domain Name:** 

      - create a domain name

      - configure CNAME of load balancer to domain name

**SSL:**

      - create a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager

      - attach it to load balancer

**Security Group:**

   ****   - port 80, 443 inbound from 0.0.0.0/0
