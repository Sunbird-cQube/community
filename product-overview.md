# Product Overview

### cQube Vision

cQube is envisioned as a ready-to-use / pre-packaged, configurable, and extendable DPG solution to enable observability and action towards effective policy implementation in education and other sectors, involving various stakeholders across govt, society, and private sectors.

* cQube for education (Ed) will accelerate adoption of VSK as envisioned under MoEâ€™s program
* The Ed configurations, along with programmatic SOPs will constitute a VSK Playbook as an additional public good

### Problem Statement

There are several challenges that government program owners face while leveraging technology for monitoring public programs:

* Program administrators face challenges in defining actionable insights and relevant indicators for tracking
* Data ingestion, processing & visualisation available as disaggregated products, not packaged into a solution
* Governments are unable to hire expert technical staff (architects, engineers) to smartly leverage a combination of available products together for end-to-end monitoring
* Governments have budget and digital infrastructure (server) limitations

### **cQube as a Solution**

cQube offers two core differential value propositions for monitoring programs:

* A domain-agnostic product packaging of ingestion, processing and visualisation layer in a manner that is:
  * Easy to deploy with minimal engineering staff
  * Lite deployment (minimal infrastructure requirements optimised to program needs)
  * Built for scale (to be scale tested with \~500k users)
  * Leverages reference schemas and spec-compliant API based implementation
  * Brownfield ready with modular components interoperable with existing systems
* Domain-specific configuration layer allowing out-of-the-box contextualisation of indicators, insights, role based nudges and actions

### cQube Ed

Vidya Samiksha Kendra was initiated by Ministry of Education as a [program](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1843168) to improve monitoring of schemes / programs in education:

* Objective to effectively collect, monitor, correlate and analyse data to take timely decisions
* Envisioned as state-level systems to monitor schemes / programs and build accountability in field-staff
* Overall goal to drive a big leap in learning outcomes through meaningful data based actions

cQube Ed is a pre-packaged solution for education with 120+ pre-defined actionable indicators & insights like attendance, assessment etc. It acts as an accelerator for states in fast tracking their Vidya Samiksha Kendra journeys.

### Design Principles for cQube Ed

cQube Ed is based on the following design principles:

1. **Solution:** cQube is neither a tool nor a platform. It is a ready-to-use/pre-packaged, configurable, and extendable solution to enable observability and action towards effective policy implementation in education and other sectors, involving various stakeholders across govt, society, and private sectors.
2. **Education-specific:** A pre-packaged solution of cQube for education, _cQube Ed_, comes with a set of predefined actionable indicators and insights which are specific to education. For eg: the metrics could be related to attendance, enrolment, assessments etc. The schema for data ingestion will also be defined for edu-specific indicators.
3. **Based in Indian Context:** cQube is based in the Indian context, implying that the jurisdictions and hierarchies will be defined accordingly. For eg: The hierarchy for cQube Ed will be as follows - State > District > Block > Cluster > School > Class.
