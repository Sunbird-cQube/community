# Business case

### Problem Statement

There are several challenges that government program owners face while leveraging technology for monitoring public programs:

* Program administrators face challenges in defining actionable insights and relevant indicators for tracking
* Data ingestion, processing & visualisation available as disaggregated products, not packaged into a solution
* Governments are unable to hire expert technical staff (architects, engineers) to smartly leverage a combination of available products together for end-to-end monitoring
* Governments have budget and digital infrastructure (server) limitations

### **cQube as a Solution**

cQube offers two core differential value propositions for monitoring programs:

* A domain-agnostic product packaging of ingestion, processing and visualisation layer in a manner that is:
  * Easy to deploy with minimal engineering staff
  * Lite deployment (minimal infrastructure requirements optimised to program needs)
  * Built for scale (to be scale tested with \~500k users)
  * Leverages reference schemas and spec-compliant API based implementation
  * Brownfield ready with modular components interoperable with existing systems
* Domain-specific configuration layer allowing out-of-the-box contextualisation of indicators, insights, role based nudges and actions
