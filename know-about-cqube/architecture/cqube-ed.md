**Need**

Vidya Samiksha Kendra was initiated by Ministry of Education as a [program](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1843168) with the following objectives:

* Improve monitoring of schemes / programs in education
* Effectively collect, monitor, correlate and analyze data to take timely decisions
* Envisioned as state-level systems to monitor schemes / programs and build accountability in field-staff
* To drive a big leap in learning outcomes through meaningful data based action

There are several challenges that government program owners face while leveraging technology for monitoring public programs:

* Data ingestion, processing & visualization available as disaggregated products, not packaged into a solution
* Lack of visibility at the granular level in the system & thus face challenges in defining actionable insights and relevant indicators for tracking
* Limitation on hiring expert technical staff (architects, engineers) to smartly leverage a combination of available products together for end-to-end monitoring
* Constraints related to budgets lead to limitations on building extensive digital infrastructure capabilities

### Solution

cQube Ed is a pre-packaged solution for education with 120+ pre-defined actionable

indicators & insights like attendance, assessment etc. It acts as an accelerator for states

in fast tracking their Vidya Samiksha Kendra journeys.
