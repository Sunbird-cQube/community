# Getting Started

## Skills Needed

Following technical skills are required to install and manage cQube v5.0:

1. **Docker**: This is required to install cQube v5.0 or upgrade from cQube v4.1 to v5.0.

2. **TypeScript / Python / NiFi**: Either of these skills are required to create the adapters to be able to ingest state data into cQube as per cQube schemas.
