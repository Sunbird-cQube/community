# Design Principles

* **Low Tech/Minimal Coding:** Leverage existing tools and provide configuration options to minimize the need for coding.
* **API First:** Design APIs for all functionality and blocks to enable independent evolution and integration.
* **Progressive Enhancement:** Allow for module changes and tiered improvements in the user experience.
* **Modularity:** Design modular blocks that can be selected and integrated based on specific needs.
* **Integrations:** Enable integration of higher-order capabilities through clear boundaries and APIs.
* **Ease of Deployment/Management:** Provide easy deployment options and support on commodity hardware or cloud platforms.
* **Scalable:**
  * **Ingestion:** Design scalable ingestion processes for real-time data updates.
  * **SLA Driven:** Strive for a 30-minute SLA between data ingestion and insight generation.
* **Performance:** Prioritize stable performance within specified hardware limitations.
* **Data Privacy:** Store only aggregated data and insights, ensuring no personally identifiable information is stored.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility on mobile and desktop devices.
* **Data Security:** Implement specific measures to safeguard data (further details required).

These design considerations aim to create a configurable, scalable, and user-friendly solution for effective data-driven governance in the education sector.
