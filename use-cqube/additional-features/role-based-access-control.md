# Role based access control

During the installation of cQube, three roles will be created within keycloak.

1. Private\_user
2. Guest (Default)
3. Admin

Any roles created will be associated with guest roles by default.

For accessing any private programs, users should be assigned private\_user.

Any user who needs access to the admin panel as well as the telemetry dashboard will have to be assigned the admin role. One can be assigned both private, guest, and admin roles, through which he will have access to every program within the dashboard.

During the installation, two users, one guest and an adminâ€”will be created and assigned appropriate roles.

Any user once created can navigate to the role mapping tab, select the required role from the available roles list, and add it so it will be associated with the user.
