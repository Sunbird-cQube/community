# Saving geographical preferences

Any private user can have their priorities and preferences set for the first time, and whenever he logs into the dashboard, preferences will be automatically selected and the respective dashboards associated with the previously selected role will be shown.

&#x20;

Any user who wants his preference to be saved for the next login can check the save my preferences checkbox before submitting the role and level details.

Once selected, the options for a particular role will be assigned to the user, and when the same user logs in again, they will be redirected directly to the dashboard with preselected values saved with the user.

If any user wants to override the preference, they can click on the home button and reselect the options that will be saved for the next login.
