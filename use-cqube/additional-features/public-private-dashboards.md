# Public/Private dashboards

During the installation, based on the inputs of the installer, access to the access for the program will be set to either public or private.

Public Access indicates that the program can be accessed via a public dashboard with a login as a user.

Private Access indicates that the program can be accessed only via a private dashboard, which is once any private or admin user is logged in.

Keycloak Admin can override the access from the keycloak admin console by following the below steps.

1. Navigate to the roles tab. Select whichever role admin wants to modify the program access to.
