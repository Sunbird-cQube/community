# Suggesting Enhancements

Any new feature enhancement can be suggested by the cQube adopters based on the needs realised.&#x20;

### Communication Tool

All the requests for support should be posted as Ideas on the cQube Discussion Forum on GitHub - [Link](https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/community/discussions/categories/ideas).

### Suggesting Enhancements on GitHub

A new discussion should be created in the GitHub Discussion Forum of cQube **only** if any similar discussion doesn't already exist or has been answered by the cQube Product Team. The unanswered / open discussions for cQube can be seen [here](https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/community/discussions/categories/ideas?discussions\_q=category%3AIdeas+is%3Aopen) and the closed discussions can be seen [here](https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/community/discussions/categories/ideas?discussions\_q=category%3AIdeas+is%3Aclosed).

**Process to initiate an idea:**

1. Go to the Ideas tab of cQube Discussion Forum on Github - [https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/community/discussions/categories/ideas](https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/community/discussions/categories/ideas)

### Response from the cQube Product Team
