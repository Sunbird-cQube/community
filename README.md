# Sunbird cQube Overview

cQube is an open-source tool used for processing data and creating the pre-defined metrics and reports, typically found in Indian states. Data ingestion to cQube happens through API. These metrics can be further drilled down to different geographical levels based on the need (e.g., State, District, Block, Cluster and School). 

Metrics are generated and visualizations are available for the generated metrics. Logged in users can view the visualization on the browser over the internet and metrics can also be downloaded for taking action or for further analysis.

cQube provides flexibility to extend to multiple use case by using the base code and adding the specific use case as per the need.
