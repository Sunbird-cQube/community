# Sunbird cQube Overview

cQube process education data typically available in Indian states. It generates pre-defined metrics and creates visualizations of these metrics on a regular basis. Data ingestion to cQube happens through API. These metrics can be further drilled down to different geographical levels based on the need (e.g., State, District, Block, Cluster and School). 

Metrics are generated and visualizations are available for the generated metrics. Logged in users can view the visualization on the browser over the internet and metrics can also be downloaded for taking action or for further analysis.

cQube provides flexibility to extend to multiple use case by using the base code and adding the specific use case as per the need.

The latest roadmap for cQube and developments on the same can be tracked on JIRA using [this](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CQ/boards/117/roadmap) link. 

The technical design for all items in the roadmap have been linked as follows:
