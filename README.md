# Sunbird cQube Overview

cQube is an open-source tool used for processing data and creating the pre-defined metrics and reports, typically found in Indian states. Data ingestion to cQube happens through API. These metrics can be further drilled down to different geographical levels based on the need (e.g., State, District, Block, Cluster and School). Metrics can be periodically maintained, and visualizations can be brought out using this data. 

Metrics and reports generated by cQube can be accessed via internet by using login credentials and reports data can be downloaded either from the cQube user interfaces or from the API.

cQube provides flexibility to extend to multiple use case by using the base code and adding the specific use case as per the need.
